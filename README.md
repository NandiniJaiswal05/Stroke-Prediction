# Machine Learning from Scratch & Scikit-Learn Simplifications

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **manual implementation of Machine Learning (ML) models** from scratch using Python. It primarily focuses on **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training** using a healthcare dataset (stroke prediction). Additionally, the project compares these manual approaches with simpler alternatives using **Scikit-Learn**, making it easier to apply ML in real-world scenarios.

## 📂 Contents
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for ML models.
- **Feature Engineering**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features.
- **Model Development (Scratch)**: Implementing ML algorithms manually without using built-in libraries.
- **Scikit-Learn Approach**: Using `sklearn` to simplify preprocessing and modeling.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluating the efficiency of both methods.

## 📊 Dataset Used
- **Name**: Healthcare Stroke Prediction Dataset
- **Source**: [Dataset Link (if applicable)]
- **Description**: Contains patient health details to predict stroke occurrences.
